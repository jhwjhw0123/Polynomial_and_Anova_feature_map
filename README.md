# Polynomial_and_Anova_feature_map
This is a small project using a iteration function calling method code the explicit feature map of polynomial and Anova kernel. <br />
The detailed introduction is in the notebook. The codes have been optimized to the best I could, and if there are any improvement suggesttions,
please inform me here or email to jhwjhw0123@gmail.com <br />
Have a nice day.
